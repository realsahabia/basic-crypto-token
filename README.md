# Coin Smart Contract

This smart contract implements a simple cryptocurrency where only the creator (minter) can mint new coins, and anyone can send these coins to each other using Ethereum addresses.

## Features

- Mint new coins: The contract creator (minter) can mint new coins and assign them to specific wallet addresses.
- Transfer coins: Anyone can send coins to other Ethereum addresses using the `send` function.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) set up.
- Connect your wallet to an Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten, or a local development network).

### Interacting with the Contract

1. Deploy the Contract: Deploy the Coin contract on an Ethereum network of your choice.

2. Mint Coins: As the contract creator (minter), use the `mint` function to mint new coins and assign them to specific wallet addresses.

3. Send Coins: Anyone can send coins to other Ethereum addresses using the `send` function.
